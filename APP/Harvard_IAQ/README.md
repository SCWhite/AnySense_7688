## How to install the codes (for new LinkIt Smart 7688 boards)?

Please login you 7688 board, and change the working directory to /root. Then, please follow the following steps:

1. Use the coommand to get the latest version of the codes: 
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/cclljj/AnySense_7688
   ```
2. Run the setup script with a secure key, which is required for data uploading to the backend database. Note that the secure key is distributed to the Harvard_IAQ project members in person only. 
   ```
 Â  /root/AnySense_7688/APP/Harvard_IAQ/setup.sh key
   ```

Then, the script will install and configure everything. The system will reboot after the installation is done, and hopefully the system will start to upload data to the backend database.
