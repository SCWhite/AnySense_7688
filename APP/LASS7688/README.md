## How to install the codes (for new LinkIt Smart 7688 boards)?

Please login you 7688 board, and change the working directory to /root. Then, please follow the following steps:

1. Use the coommand to get the latest version of the codes: 
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/cclljj/AnySense_7688
   ```
2. Run the setup script:
   ```
   /root/AnySense_7688/APP/LASS7688/setup.sh
