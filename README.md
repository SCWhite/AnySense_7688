This is the AnySense project for MediaTek LinkIt 7688 board. The codes will conduct sensing tasks and report the results to the LASS MQTT broker. The codes are based on MRAA library in Python, so hopefully it will run smoothly on the other MRAA-supported boards.

## Sensors supported (till 2017/11/12)
* Temperature and Humidity Sensor
  * HTU21d (I2C)
  * SHT2x (I2C)
* Light Sensor
  * BH1750FVI (I2C)
* Particulate Matter Sensor
  * Plantower PMS3003 (UART0)
  * Plantower PMS5003 (UART0)
  * Plantower PMS5003T (UART0)
  * Plantower PMS7003 (UART0)
  * Plantower PMSA003 (UART0)
* Gas Sensor
  * SenseAir S8 (UART1)
  * Sensirion SGP30 (I2C)
 
## How to run this program?
Please login you development board, and change to your working directory. Then, please follow the following steps:

1. Use the coommand to get the latest version of the codes: 
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/cclljj/AnySense_7688
   ```

2. Install phao library by the command (no need if you are using RESTful)
   ```
   pip install paho-mqtt
   ```
   
3. Edit the file AnySense_config.py and change the configureations
   * Sense_PM: Enable PM sensor (1) or Not (0)
   * Sense_Tmp: Enable Temperature/Humidity sensor (1) or Not (0)
   * Sense_Light: Enable Light sensor (1) or Not (0)
   * Sense_Gas: Enable Gas sensor (1) or Not (0)
   ***
   * import xxx as pm_sensor: Change xxx to the corresponding module (or leave it unchanged if you don't need a PM sensor)
   * import xxx as tmp_sensor: Change xxx to the corresponding module (or leave it unchanged if you don't need a Temperature/Humidity sensor)
   *Â import xxx as light_sensor: Change xxx to the corresponding module (or leave it unchanged if you don't need a light sensor)
   * import xxx as gas_sensor: Change xxx to the corresponding module (or leave it unchanged if you don't need a gas sensor)
   ***
   * GPS coordinates: including GPS_LAT and GPS_LON
   * LASS settings: including APP_ID, DEVICE, and DEVICE_ID
   * MQTT settings: including MQTT_broker, MQTT_port, MQTT_topic, and MQTT_interval
   
4. Run the main program by
   ```
   python AnySense.py
   ```

5. You can check the results on the console printouts or on the MQTT broker.
